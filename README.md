# FiveInARow
This is the game Jätkänshakki. A Finnish game usually played with square paper and a pen. Two players take turns placing their respective X or O markers on the squares of the graph paper. The aim is to form a continuous straight line of five of your markers, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, before your opponent does.

The purpose of creating this game is just to do something fun with Vue.js to practise the framework.
